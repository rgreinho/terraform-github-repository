# GitHub Repository

Create a new repository.

## Example Usage

### Create public (e.g. open source) repository

```hcl
module "repository" {
  source = "innovationnorway/repository/github"

  name = "example"

  description = "My example codebase"

  private = false

  gitignore_template = "Node"
  license_template   = "mit"

  topics = ["example"]
}
```

### Add collaborators and teams

```hcl
module "repository" {
  source = "innovationnorway/repository/github"

  name = "example"

  description = "My example codebase"

  collaborators = [
    {
      username   = "joakimhellum-in"
      permission = "push"
    },
    {
      username   = "innovationnorway-bot"
      permission = "pull"
    },
  ]

  teams = [
    {
      name       = "terraform"
      permission = "push"
    },
    {
      name       = "security"
      permission = "pull"
    },
  ]
}
```

### Add deploy keys

```hcl
module "repository" {
  source = "innovationnorway/repository/github"

  name = "example"

  description = "My example codebase"

  deploy_keys = [
    {
      title = "example-key"
      key   = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA..."

      read_only = true
    },
  ]
}
```
